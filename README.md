DOI for current stable release [v2.0.0](https://github.com/smart-facility/cognicity-schema/releases/tag/v2.0.0): [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/19201/smart-facility/cognicity-schema.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/19201/smart-facility/cognicity-schema)

### About
CogniCity-schema is the PostgreSQL/PostGIS database schema for the CogniCity Framework.  The schema contains the tables required for data input by [cognicity-reports](https://github.com/smart-facility/cognicity-reports-powertrack), [cognicity-reports-detik](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-reports-detik), [cognicity-reports-lambda](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-reports-lambda), [cognicity-reports-telegram](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-reports-telegram) and data output using [cognicity-server](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-server).

For a comprehensive overview of CogniCity v1.0, including the original database schema see Chapter 2 of:

Assessing the Role of Social Media for Civic Coâ€‘Management During Monsoon Flooding
in Jakarta, Indonesia", 2014. Holderness T & Turpin E. [ISBN 978-1-74128-249-8 ](http://petajakarta.org/banjir/en/research/)

#### Reports
Input data sources for reporting are received into separate schemas, named by report types. Trigger functions in each data source's schema normalise the different report data and push it to the global cognicity.all_reports table (see Table below).

#### Risk Evaluation Matrix (REM)
Flood affected area polygon data provided by emergency services via the REM interface is stored in the cognicity.rem_status table. The geographic data for these areas is stored in the cognicity.local_areas table.

* Hydrological data are available from [Research Data Australia](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/petajakartaorg/552178) (Australian National Data Service), with DOIs held by the National Library of Australia.

### Dependencies
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) version 9.5 or later, with
* [PostGIS](http://postgis.net) version 2.0 or later

### Installation
* The PostgreSQL database server must be running with a UTF-8 character set.

#### Installing the schema and data
This build `build/run.sh` script looks for the following environment variables:
- $PGHOST
- $PGUSER
- $PGDATABASE
- $COUNTRY

Country names should match the name specified in the `/data/` folder.

To install the database and load data for specified country run:
```sh
$ export COUNTRY=indonesia
$ build/run.sh
```
This will create a database "cognicity", build the empty schema and insert available data.


### Testing
Tests are run using NodeJS with Unit.js and Mocha to insert dummy values and perform integration testing on the database against the sample data sources.
To run tests:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

* Issues are tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-schema/issues)
